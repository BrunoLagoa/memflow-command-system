# Degraded mode common base (normative reference)

Apply this block when `.agents` is unavailable, missing or incomplete.

## Degraded mode

- Do not automatically block just due to the absence of `.agents`.
- Activate degraded mode and explicitly warn in the response.
- Proceed with available sources:
  - `docs`
  - `model-policy.md` resolved by active target (via `_shared/target-adapter.md`)
  - actual project code
  - MCPs available
- Reduce confidence in conclusions and record limitations.

## Precedence rule

- This file defines the common pattern.
- Specific rules for each command can extend this pattern.
- Non-overwriteable invariants:
  - absence of `.agents` does not automatically block
  - limitations must be explicitly reported
  - reliability of the analysis should be reduced
