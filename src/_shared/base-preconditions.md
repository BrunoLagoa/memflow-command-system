# Common base of preconditions (normative reference)

Apply this block of preconditions to operational commands.

---

## Early activation rule (CRITICAL)

Before applying any precondition block, identify the active command.

If the active command is `/context`:

- DO NOT require prior context
- DO NOT ask the user to run `/context` again
- immediately execute the context, memory, metrics, skills and anti-compaction invariant loading defined by `/context` itself

If the active command is `/memory-init`:

- allow bootstrapping the memory structure without prior context
- after bootstrap, guide re-entry through `/context`

---

## Context precondition (REQUIRED)

Before any execution, except `/context` and `/memory-init`:

- Check if the `/context` command was executed

If NO:

- BLOCK execution
- Request execution of `/context`
- DO NOT continue

---

## Anti-compaction invariants (REQUIRED)

Before any operational command (except `/context`), validate that `/context` has confirmed:

- mandatory language: pt-BR
- project identity and scope: Memflow Command System

If invariants are missing or failed:

- BLOCK execution
- require re-execution of `/context`
- DO NOT continue in partial silent mode

---

## Safe continuity checklist (anti-bypass)

Before proceeding to any critical step, confirm:

- explicit decision of available `/workflow` (when applicable)
- valid anti-compaction invariants (pt-BR + Memflow)
- explicit user confirmation before executing the next command in the flow

If any item fails:

- BLOCK continuity
- record problem in output
- request corrective action before proceeding

---

## Memory validation (MANDATORY)

If persistent memory exists in the project:

- .agents/memory/memory.md
- .agents/memory/session-memory.md
- .agents/memory/decisions.md
- .agents/memory/quality-metrics.md

So:

- ensure it was charged by `/context`
- use as a primary context base

---

## Memory not loaded

If memory exists but has NOT been loaded:

- consider incomplete context
- DO NOT proceed with critical execution
- recommend re-execution of `/context`

---

## Lack of memory

If memory does NOT exist:

- operate normally
- use docs, code and MCPs as fallback

---

## Exception: `/context` command

- DOES NOT require prior context
- This command is responsible for:
  - load context
  - load memory
  - validate environment

---

## Exception: `/memory-init` command

- can bootstrap from memory structure without prior context
- after bootstrap, must require reentry via `/context` before any critical execution

---

## Canonical boot order

1. `/memory-init` (only when memory structure does not exist)
2. `/context` (context and memory mandatory loading)
3. decision commands/execution (`/workflow`, `/execute`, `/plan`, etc.)

## Global consistency rule

- No command can execute without valid context
- No command can ignore available memory
- Avoid execution with partial or inconsistent context
- No critical command can execute without valid anti-compaction invariants

---

## Path resolution (required)

- Rules for resolving normative paths and `model-policy.md` must follow `_shared/target-adapter.md`.
- Never infer paths outside the target adapter.
- When the active command is already loaded:
  - assume the root of this command as the context of normative resolution
  - do not ask the user for manual confirmation about the location of `_shared/*.md` and `model-policy.md`
- If the adapter is not available:
  - report absence
  - DO NOT use fallback

---

## Precedence rule

- This file defines global execution invariants.
- Commands can extend operational rules, without invalidating invariants.
- Non-overwriteable invariants:
  - no critical execution without `/context`
  - available memory cannot be ignored
  - normative resolution must follow `_shared/target-adapter.md`
  - anti-compaction invariants (pt-BR + Memflow) must be valid before critical execution

---

## Important

- This file ensures system consistency
- Avoid execution without context
- Ensures correct memory usage
